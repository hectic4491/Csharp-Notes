C# comes with a lot of extra configuartion files.
To navigate to the main script, which is just a collection of basic c# syntax and statements, go to:
  HelloWorld\Program.cs


Where is C# used?

Windows desktop apps. If you want to build pure Windows applications that
use the latest and greatest Windows APIs, use C#. Because of this, it's 
really big in the Enterprise world, basically software that runs inside
large corporations, as opposed to software that's sold to end-users.

The other is for games, such as the Unity engine.
